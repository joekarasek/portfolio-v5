This app is designed to function as a question and answer board. Users can create questions, edit and update questions, and delete questions. Users can also create and view multiple answers for each question (a one to many database relationship).

This web-app was built using the [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) framework. This web-app uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) for its database.

This code was put together for the week 3 code review for the Level 2 Javascript Epicodus course.
