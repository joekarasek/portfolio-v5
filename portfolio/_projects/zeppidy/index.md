[_**Zeppidy, Inc.**_](http://www.zeppidy.com) - The Home Buying & Selling Platformâ„¢ is a Portland, Oregon tech startup streamlining the real estate process for buyers, sellers, and agents.

Over a five week internship with Zeppidy I had the opportunity to work on a number of front- and back-end micro-services used in the production site. 

The main project I worked on was a _*Market Trends*_ viewer that allows users to explore a wide range of market statistics related to any listed property. Users can explore a number of charts, graphics, and maps related to market statistics, and can quickly and easily filter information by area (city, zip, or neighborhood) and time intervals (monthly, quarterly, yearly).  I had the honor to include the _*Market Trends*_ in the launch of the site.
> Note:
> To view a live version of the Market Trends component, simply navigate to the page for any currently listed property on [Zeppidy](http://www.zeppidy.com) and tap/click the Market Trends drawer on the bottom of the page.**

I also had the opportunity to assisted other interns in the development of components including a type-ahead predictive search bar, a photo masonry and carousel lightbox, and a wrapper component fot the entire property listing page.

In addition to working on Zeppidy's software, I got to practice a range of other professional skills including...
  - demoing software to clients.
  - deploying projects and managing the development server.
  - identifying and fixing bugs in the code base based on user feedback.
  - coordinating with a diverse team on a large project.
