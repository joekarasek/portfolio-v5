_**pdxRoasted**_ lets users explore Portland's wonderful selection of roasted coffees. Users can create a flavor profile of one or more flavors, and are given a list of roasts based on their choices. Jason, Ryan, and built the backend of the Angular 2 app while Brooke and Taylor put together a wonderful front-end. This project was a great further exploration of Angular 2.
