_**Sportal**_ is brings people together for recreational sports. Users can search for pick-up games, leagues, races, and places to play by location and category. Users can also create two level of accounts; a user that can post pick-up games and places to play, and a user that can post leagues and races. Several custom modules and a custom theme were built for this project.
