You are currently viewing the latest version (v3) of my professional web development portfolio. This site was built using Polymer, the .... and is hosted on Digital Ocean.

I chose Polymer to build this site because I enjoyed the ease with which I can create interactive components without writing tons of boiler plate javascript, and I like the fast, sleek, progressive web app UI experience that Polymer creates.

My previous portfolio was built with Jekyll, a static website generator, which uses content stored in markdown file with YAML front-matter. I really like this clean and simple way of storing a record of my projects, and I wanted to keep it for this version of my portfolio, so I wrote a custom Node.js script that converts all my markdown files into a single json file that is easily consumed by Polymer.
