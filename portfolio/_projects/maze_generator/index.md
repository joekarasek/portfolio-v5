_**Mazes**_ is a side project of mine. It is an exploration of the algorithms used to generate mazes and the biases these algorithms produce in the mazes. The current version of this app lets you choose from three algorithms (Binary Tree, Sidewinder, and Aldous-Broder), choose the size of your maze, and fills the maze with color to highlight the 'texture' of the maze (a visually easy way to reveal biases).
